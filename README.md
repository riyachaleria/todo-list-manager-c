Welcome to your personal **To-Do List Manager**, a command-line based task management application written in **C**.  
It allows you to organize, update, and track your tasks with ease — complete with secure password access and file persistence.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **Admin Login** with password hashing (DJB2 algorithm)
- ➕ **Add Tasks** with unique IDs
- ✅ **Mark Tasks as Completed**
- 🔍 **Search Tasks** with case-insensitive keyword matching
- 📊 **Priority Levels** (Low / Medium / High)
- 📂 **View Tasks** filtered by status: All, Completed, Incomplete
- ✏️ **Update** description, status, or priority
- 🔄 **Reindexing** of IDs after deletion
- 🗑️ **Delete Tasks** individually or in bulk
- 💾 **Backup & Restore** from separate binary files
- 📤 **Export to CSV** for spreadsheet viewing
- 📉 **Sort Tasks** by priority (Asc / Desc)
- 💾 **Persistent Storage** via binary file I/O
- 🧠 **Dynamic Memory Allocation** used throughout

## 🧑‍💻 How to Compile & Run

Make sure you have GCC installed.

```bash
gcc sourcecode.c -o sourcecode.exe
./sourcecode

🔐 Admin Login with Hashed Password
This project includes a **secure admin login system** using a **custom hashing function**.

When the program starts, users must enter the correct admin password.  
The entered password is hashed using the `simplehash()` function and compared with a pre-defined hash value.

✅ Default Password
Password: admin@g139

(Used only for demo; can be changed using the helper below)

🔒 Internally stored as:
#define password_hash 8246073859955783634

## 🔑 Changing the Admin Password

To change the password, you'll need to calculate the hash of your new password using the same hashing method used in the program (`simplehash()`).

Instead of modifying the full project, you can generate the hash using a small helper C program.

🛠️ A file called `hash_generator.c` is included in this repository. Compile and run it to get the hashed value of your desired password:

```bash
gcc hash_generator.c -o hash_generater
./hash_generater
Enter your new password when needed, and it will give you a hash like:

Hashed value: 7639281883728628837
Now, go to your main C file and update this line:
#define password_hash 8246073859955783634
with:
#define password_hash 7639281883728628837
Recompile and you're done!
✅ This makes your new password active without storing it in plain text.

🏗️ Project Structure (Inside the Code)
struct task contains: ID, description, status, priority

File I/O with binary format for efficiency

Modular functions for each operation

Uses malloc, realloc, and free to manage memory

Friendly UI prompts with confirmations before destructive actions
